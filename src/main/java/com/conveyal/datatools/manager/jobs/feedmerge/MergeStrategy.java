     *   Trips that do not match on stop_times will be handled with the below approaches.
     *   Note: Same service IDs shall be used (but extended to account for the full range of dates from active to future).
     * - *trip_id in active feed*: A new service shall be created starting from the merge date and expiring at the end
     *   of active service period.
     *   Note: a new service_id will be generated for these active trips in the merged feed (rather than using the
     *   service_id with extended range).
     * - *trip_id in future feed*: A new service shall be created for these trips with service period defined in future
     *   feed
     *   Note: a new service_id will be generated for these future trips in the merged feed (rather than using the
     *   service_id with extended range).
